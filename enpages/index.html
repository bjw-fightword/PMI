								            <h3>Mr. Mark Langley</h3>
											<p>PMI President and CEO</p>
											<p>Mark A. Langley became PMI’s President and CEO in December 2010 after serving over eight years as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. In the chief executive role, Mr. Langley is responsible for overseeing and serving as the lead advocate for PMI’s complex global organization, consisting of more than half a million members, certification holders and other stakeholders in more than 185 countries.

											<p>In his previous role, Mr. Langley was responsible for creating and cultivating alignment of PMI’s operating groups to drive market and business development; as well as inspiring lasting and loyal relationships with members, volunteers and other stakeholders that helped advance the profession and drive customer satisfaction in worldwide markets. During his leadership, PMI’s stakeholder base has grown five-fold and transitioned from primarily North American to a truly global representation. During that time, PMI also introduced additional professional certifications, developed program and portfolio management standards, and published several practice guidelines. Mr. Langley has spent countless hours demonstrating the value of project management to practitioners, organizations and governments as well as collaborating with volunteer leaders, and working with communities to advance the profession of project management.</p>
											<p>Mr. Langley joined PMI in 2002 as Director, Finance and Administration and was promoted shortly thereafter to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Prior to joining PMI, he served as Chief Financial Officer for ChemLogix and held senior leadership positions with AssetTRADE.com, Quala Systems, Inc. and Castle Energy Corp. He began his career at Price Waterhouse (now PwC) and is a Certified Public Accountant.
